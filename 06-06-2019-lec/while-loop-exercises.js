/* Exercise 0: Houston Count Down to 0
   Program Specs: Write a program, using a while loop, that prints out the following pattern
                  to the console. Starting from "Houston, count down: 10", all the way down
                  to "Houston, count down: 0"
   Program Output:
    >>> "Houston, count down: 10"
    >>> "Houston, count down: 9"
    ...
    >>> "Houston, count down: 0"
 */

/* Exercise 1: Houston Count Down, and Blast Off
   Program Specs: Write a program, using a while loop, similar to exercise 1, except when the count
           is 0, you want to print out, "BlAST OFF ! > > > > !"
   Program Output:
    >>> "Houston, count down: 10"
    >>> "Houston, count down: 9"
    ...
    >>> "Houston, count down: 1"
    >>> "BLAST OFF ! > > > > !"

/* Exercise 2: Print Triangle
   Program Specs: Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to 
                  output the following triangle:
 */

/* Exercise 3: "Fizz", "Buzz"
   Program Specs: Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers
                  from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
                  For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
                  and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
 */

 /* Exercise 4: "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz"
    Program Specs: Modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible
                   by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible 
                   by only one of those).

 /* Exercise 5: Is 97 a prime number? 
    Program Specs: Without checking online whether 97 is a prime number or not, write 
                   a pogram that determines whether 97 is a prime number. If your program
                   determines that 97 is a prime number, 
                   print to the console, "97 is a prime number!",
                   otherwise, print to the console. "97 is not a prime number!"

    Note: Try this out with different numbers and see what your result will be
